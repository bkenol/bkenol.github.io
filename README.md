# Viul Website
This is a repository for the website I created for my music under the artist name Viul. This was previously the page for a music duo that I was part of called SIVANCY, but I have begun to process of repurposing this website for a personal portfolio. This website was primarily designed with modified Bootstrap, and primarily programmed with vanilla JavaScript.

## Content

### Music Page

This is a page dedicated to the music that I'm currentliy working on and releasing under my current name. It contains players for each of the previous releases, which have links to the SoundCloud page for each song, and a download button for each song. I designed and programmed each player with JavaScript and CSS. 

### SIVANCY Music Page

This is a page dedicated to the SIVANCY Music that was released in the past. This page is designed the same way that the primary Music page was.
